This app will monitor for iBeacons in my house and send me a notification of my choosing next time I come close to the beacon.

e.g, Walk to front door -> "Don't forget your lunch max"

Could then be extended to match more complex rules:

e.g, Walk to front door, before 9am -> "Don't forget your lunch"
     Walk to front door, after 5pm -> "Don't forget your car keys"
